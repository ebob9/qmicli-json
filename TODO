List of things left for later:
----------------------------------------

Short Term: 

 * Finish conversion (qmicli.c 90%, qmicli-nas 50%, rest currently 0%).

 * Fix/verify type casts (ex: G_GUINT16 to Jansson "i").

 * Verify that vars are free'd correctly when used and no exit.

Long Term:

 * JSON imput support from stdin instead of switches.

 * Change output structure from original qmicli to 'make more sense'.

 * Make qmicli-json more of a direct QMI->JSON xlation layer.
