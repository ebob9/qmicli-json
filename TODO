List of things left for later:
----------------------------------------

Short Term: 

 * Finish conversion (qmicli.c 98%, qmicli-nas 100%, rest currently 0%).

 * Fix/verify type casts (ex: G_GUINT16 to Jansson "i").

 * Verify that vars are free'd correctly when used and no exit.

 * Write function to convert comma-seperated lists to JSON array.

Long Term:

 * Figure out how to handle async error/output situations.

 * JSON imput support from stdin instead of switches.

 * Change output structure from original qmicli to 'make more sense'.

 * Make qmicli-json more of a direct QMI->JSON xlation layer.
