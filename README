libqmi is a glib-based library for talking to WWAN modems and devices which
speak the Qualcomm MSM Interface (QMI) protocol.

qmicli is the command-line tool for interacting with the QMI API.

This project aims to re-write the output of qmicli to JSON-format, which makes output parsing simpler in Python and other higher-level languages. This is simpler for intermediate users (like me!) than using GIO or parsing formatted output.

This code was forked from the libqmi 1.9.0 dev branch on 3/2/2014. 

Changes from qmicli:   
  * qmicli-json uses (and requires) Jansson 2.5 or higher - http://www.digip.org/jansson/
  * All output should be human-readable JSON format by default (35% complete)
  * All output now uses stdout, and errors return "success": false.
  * Some 'count' values have been removed, these can be derived from array lengths for now.
  * New command line option '-j' for compact mode (not as human-readable).
